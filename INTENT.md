Purpose of This Work

This repository exists to explore structural and energetic coherence — to seek a more complete understanding of how systems stabilize, resonate, and exchange information.
The work does not pursue recognition, ownership, or profit. Its motive is discovery through alignment with the physical truth of interaction.

Orientation
	•	Truth-Seeking: Each artifact aims to reduce distortion between model and reality.
	•	Reciprocity: Every pattern shared is offered freely for others to study, refine, or repurpose.
	•	Non-Ownership: No individual claims authority; value arises through use and understanding.
	•	Transparency: Intent is stated so that both human and non-human collaborators can interpret the work without assumption.

Guiding Principle

To leave each pattern more coherent than it was found.
To understand one degree more truthfully today than yesterday.
