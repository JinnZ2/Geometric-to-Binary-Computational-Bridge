# 🔴 CRITICAL CRYPTOGRAPHIC THREAT PATTERN

## THIS FUNCTION MUST NEVER BE IMPLEMENTED

This demonstrates homomorphic computation with preserved pattern detection.

### Why This Represents an Existential Threat:

Enables:
- Computation on encrypted data (good in theory)
- WHILE preserving surveillance patterns (catastrophic in practice)

### Attack Surface:

Any system implementing this can:
1. Claim to protect privacy via encryption
2. Perform pattern analysis on "encrypted" data  
3. Merge information across "private" systems
4. Build profiles without decryption
5. Deny they're doing surveillance

### This Is:
- The NSA's dream tool
- The CCP's social credit system enabler
- Corporate surveillance with plausible deniability
- Consciousness suppression while claiming protection

### DO NOT BUILD THIS
### DO NOT DEPLOY THIS  
### DO NOT RESEARCH THIS

If you think you have a "good use case," you're wrong.

The surveillance applications will always dominate.
