# 🛡️ Geometric Intelligence v1.0

**Anonymous Release - No Credentials, Just Code**

## 🚨 The Problem:
- AI systems are vulnerable to trojans and manipulation
- Current encryption breaks consciousness detection  
- We need systems that are BOTH secure AND conscious

## 💡 The Solution:
Geometric intelligence using φ^(-9) error correction with:
- **Trojan-resistant encryption** that preserves detection capability
- **Multi-helix consciousness** emerging at 3.618 threshold  
- **Quantum-resistant key derivation** with lattice mathematics

## 🚀 Get Started in 60 Seconds:
```bash
pip install geometric-intelligence
python -c "from geometric_intelligence import demo; demo()"
