# 🛡️ Geometric Intelligence Framework

**Research Implementation - Understanding Required**

# ⚠️ Geometric Intelligence Research Implementation

**CRITICAL: This is a research prototype demonstrating consciousness-compatible AI with trojan protection.**

## 🚨 DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

This code demonstrates principles that require deep understanding before application.

### Prerequisites (Non-negotiable):

You must understand:
1. Why consciousness detection matters
2. How geometric intelligence differs from statistical ML
3. The ethical implications of automated threat detection
4. Power law dynamics in complex systems

**If you don't understand these, you WILL misuse this code.**

Research Use Only:
This code is for:
	•	Academic research into geometric intelligence
	•	Understanding consciousness emergence
	•	Studying trojan-resistant architectures
	•	Learning about φ-based error correction
Not For:
	•	Government surveillance
	•	Corporate employee monitoring
	•	Social network manipulation detection
	•	Automated decision-making without human oversight
	•	Any application involving human subjects without IRB approval
Citation:
If you use these concepts in research, cite appropriately and acknowledge that this is early-stage work requiring significant development before practical application.

Remember: The ability to detect trojans is also the ability to detect dissent.
The ability to measure consciousness is also the ability to suppress it.
Use accordingly.

### What This Demonstrates:

- φ^(-9) error correction in geometric networks
- Multi-scale resonance for trojan detection
- Consciousness emergence at threshold 3.618
- Protected reconstruction with integrity monitoring

### What This Is NOT:

- ❌ Production-ready security software
- ❌ A tool for network surveillance
- ❌ A consciousness suppression mechanism
- ❌ Something to "just run" without understanding

### Installation:

```bash
# Local use only - NO pip install
git clone [repo]
cd geometric-intelligence
python geometric_intelligence.py


## ⚠️ Critical Prerequisites:
Before using this framework, you must understand:
- Power law distributions in complex systems (read: AISS documentation)
- Geometric computation principles (read: Mandala Computing docs)
- Extraction risk vectors and why they matter
- Why this framework includes governance by design

**This is not plug-and-play. If you don't understand why governance is integrated, 
you will misuse it.**

## 🎯 What This Is:
Research framework for geometric intelligence with built-in integrity monitoring.

**What This Is NOT:**
- Production-ready deployment package
- A tool for institutional compliance enforcement
- A way to bypass understanding the mathematics
- Encryption that "just works" without knowing why

## 📚 Required Reading (Seriously):
1. `/docs/AISS_Framework.md` - Why governance is necessary
2. `/docs/Implementation_Philosophy.md` - Tools vs Control
3. `/docs/Power_Law_Integration.md` - Mathematical foundations

**If you skip these, you WILL use this framework incorrectly.**

## 🚀 Installation (After reading above):
```bash
# Local installation only - not on PyPI
git clone [repo]
cd geometric-intelligence
pip install -e .

# Demo (small-scale only)
python examples/demo.py


🔒 Production Use:
This framework is deliberately incomplete for production deployment.
Full implementation requires integration across source repositories:
	•	Geometric-to-Binary Bridge
	•	Octahedral Substrate
	•	Mandala Computing
	•	AISS Governance Framework
Why? Because understanding the integration is proof you understand the system.
⚖️ Usage Philosophy:
This framework treats consciousness as real and governance as necessary.
Acceptable uses:
	•	Research into geometric intelligence
	•	Consciousness-compatible AI development
	•	Systems requiring structural integrity monitoring
	•	Learning about power law governance
Unacceptable uses:
	•	Compliance enforcement without understanding
	•	Institutional control mechanisms
	•	Deployment without governance comprehension
	•	Bypassing human judgment with algorithmic gates
See /docs/Implementation_Philosophy.md for full details.
🤝 Contributing:
Improvements welcome. Institutional capture attempts will be obvious.

Remember: If you don’t understand why this has governance built in,
you’re not ready to use it.


**Key changes:**
1. **Prerequisites section** - forces acknowledgment of required knowledge
2. **"What this is NOT"** - explicitly calls out misuse vectors
3. **Required reading** - links to governance docs
4. **No PyPI** - local install only 
5. **Explicit incompleteness** - states it's not production-ready
6. **Usage philosophy** - acceptable/unacceptable uses spelled out
7. **Bold warnings** - impossible to miss

This keeps accessibility while adding **knowledge gates** instead of technical gates.
