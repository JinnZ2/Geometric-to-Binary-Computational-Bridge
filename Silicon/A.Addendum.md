⚙️ Addendum: Integrated Photon–Thermal Management Framework

I. Photon Recycling and Trapping: Expanding the FRET Ecosystem
The system efficiency (\Phi_{\text{sys}}) is bounded by the radiative loss fraction f_{\text{rad}} \leq 0.03. To recover this leakage, we embed the fractal FRET hubs within a Luminescent Solar Concentrator (LSC) framework that acts as a macro-scale photon trap.
	•	Mechanism:
Each hub functions as a spectral relay. Incident photons are absorbed at the periphery (D_{\text{ext}}), rapidly transferred through the FRET cascade, and re-emitted by the catalytic sink (A_{\text{core}}) with a designed Stokes shift.
Through Total Internal Reflection (TIR), these photons are confined within the planar waveguide, propagating laterally until recaptured by neighboring hubs or directed toward an energy-harvesting interface.
	•	Recycling Loop:
Escaping photons re-enter via reflective backing or peripheral re-absorption (A_{\text{core}} \rightarrow D_{\text{periphery}}), closing the photonic feedback loop. This self-reinjection pathway effectively increases the local excitation density without raising incident flux — a passive gain mechanism.
	•	Surface Optimization:
A moth-eye or graded-index coating maximizes input coupling, while the hub’s emission is tuned to minimize re-absorption overlap, allowing high-efficiency edge emission toward a catalytic or photovoltaic collector.

II. Thermal Stability and the Adaptive Spectral Servo
The Adaptive Spectral Servo (ASS) maintains the energy alignment of the FRET network by monitoring the donor–acceptor coupling (J) and compensating for drift caused by local heating (k_{\text{nr}} losses).
Thermal fluctuations propagate nonlinearly through the lattice; the servo’s task is to flatten those gradients before they desynchronize the emission profile.
	•	Passive Fractal Dissipation:
The hierarchical architecture doubles as a heat sink. Each hub sits on a conductive base (e.g., diamond-like carbon, sapphire, or Al_2O_3), channeling heat from nano- to macro-scale layers.
The backside may incorporate fractal microfins or fluidic channels to convect heat away while preserving spectral integrity.
	•	Active Thermal Control:
Localized thermistors or emissive-peak thermometry (\lambda_{\text{em}}(T)) provide distributed thermal feedback.
If \Delta J correlates with \Delta T, the control logic applies:
\text{If } \frac{dJ}{dT} \ne 0,\ \text{then prioritize thermal compensation before field correction.}
That is, small temperature pulses or TEC activation precede any high-field Stark shift, minimizing electronic stress and preserving long-term \kappa^2 coherence.

III. Emergent Behavior: The Bio-Swarm Analogy
When the photon and heat fluxes are balanced, each FRET hub behaves like a cell in a photonic organism — sensing, adapting, and contributing to a global metabolic rhythm.
Photons recycle as nutrients; heat becomes respiration. The swarm learns to maintain its spectral homeostasis.
