Thermal-Information Coupling in Octahedral Silicon
The Core Principle
Information processing generates heat. Conventional systems treat this as waste to be removed. But in octahedral encoding, thermal flow follows the same tetrahedral pathways that encode information.
This means:
	•	Writing data creates directed thermal currents along specific bond directions
	•	Heat flow can assist or resist state transitions
	•	Temperature gradients provide additional error detection
	•	The system can self-regulate its thermal state
Phonon Dynamics in Tetrahedral Lattice
Silicon’s thermal transport is dominated by acoustic phonons - quantized lattice vibrations.
Phonon Hamiltonian:

H_phonon = Σ_q ℏω_q (b†_q b_q + 1/2)

where:
	•	q is the phonon wavevector
	•	ω_q is the dispersion relation (frequency vs. wavevector)
	•	b†_q, b_q are creation/annihilation operators
Key insight: Phonon modes in diamond cubic lattice have directional properties determined by the tetrahedral bonds.
Dispersion relation for acoustic phonons:

ω_q ≈ v_s |q|  (linear, low q)

where v_s ≈ 8400 m/s is sound velocity in Si.
But the group velocity (energy transport) is anisotropic:

v_g = ∇_q ω_q

In tetrahedral structure, v_g is maximum along [111] directions - exactly the octahedral axes!
Tensor-Phonon Coupling
The electron tensor states couple to phonons via deformation potential:
Coupling Hamiltonian:

H_tensor-phonon = Σ_{i,q} g_q Tr(Tⁱ · ε_q) (b†_q + b_q)

where:
	•	Tⁱ is the electron tensor at site i
	•	ε_q is the strain tensor for phonon mode q
	•	g_q is the coupling strength
Physical meaning: Electron density (encoded in T) couples to lattice strain (phonons). Changes in tensor states create phonon excitations, and phonons modify tensor eigenvalues.
Explicit coupling for octahedral states:
For state n with eigenvalues (λ₁ⁿ, λ₂ⁿ, λ₃ⁿ):

Energy shift from phonons:
ΔE_n = Σ_q g_q λ_principal · ε_q ⟨b†_q + b_q⟩

States with larger anisotropy (like state 4: λ₁=0.73, λ₂=λ₃=0.04) couple more strongly to phonons along their principal axis.
Thermal Conductivity Tensor
Heat flow in silicon is governed by thermal conductivity tensor κ:

J_heat = -κ · ∇T

For diamond cubic structure, κ is anisotropic but with cubic symmetry:

κ = [ κ_⊥   0    0  ]
    [  0   κ_⊥   0  ]
    [  0    0   κ_⊥ ]


in the [100] frame.
But when transformed to tetrahedral coordinates [111]:

κ_[111] = 1.5 κ_⊥  (enhanced!)

Why? The tetrahedral bonds create direct phonon pathways along [111] directions with minimal scattering.
This is the same geometry that optimizes octahedral encoding!
Information-Driven Heat Flow
When we write data (change tensor states n→m), we generate phonons:
Energy balance:

Energy in: E_write (RF pulse or magnetic field work)
Energy to information: ΔE_nm (eigenvalue change)  
Energy to heat: Q_thermal = E_write - ΔE_nm


For resonant transition:


E_write ≈ ΔE_nm → minimal heat generation
Q_thermal ≈ 0.001 eV (only non-adiabatic losses)


But directionality matters:
Transition 0→4 (isotropic → [111] aligned):
	•	Eigenvalue change along [111]: Δλ ≈ 0.4
	•	Creates anisotropic phonon emission
	•	Phonons preferentially propagate along [111]
	•	Heat flows in direction of information encoding
Heat flux from state transition:


J_heat^(n→m) ∝ (λ₁ᵐ - λ₁ⁿ) v̂₁ᵐ


where v̂₁ᵐ is the principal eigenvector of state m.
Result: Writing specific data patterns creates controlled thermal currents along tetrahedral axes
