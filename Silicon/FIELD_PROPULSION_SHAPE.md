üåÄ Field Propulsion Shape ‚Äî Concept & Analytic Basis

Overview

This document describes the physical intuition and testable framework behind the field-sequential propulsion system represented in
Field_Propulsion_Analog.json and field_propulsion_analog.ino.

The concept arose from observing self-amplifying harmonic fields that resemble octopus jet propulsion, but operating through sequential energy coupling rather than fluid expulsion. The shape behaves as a 3-D traveling-wave cavity, where energy density and phase timing interact to produce a net momentum flow through the medium.

1. Physical Model

1.1 Sequential Energy Coupling

Each node emits a field F_i(t) = A_i \sin(\omega_i t + \phi_i).
Neighboring nodes interact through coupling constant k_c:

F_{net}(t) = \sum_i A_i \sin(\omega_i t + \phi_i) +
k_c \sum_i A_i A_{i+1} \sin(\phi_{i+1} - \phi_i)

When the phase offset \Delta\phi = \phi_{i+1} - \phi_i is constant,
a traveling wave forms and energy propagates directionally.

1.2 Directional Momentum Flow

Local Poynting-like momentum density:

\vec{p} = \frac{1}{c^2} \, \vec{E} \times \vec{H}

In the analog prototype:
	‚Ä¢	For acoustics, E,H correspond to pressure p and particle velocity v.
	‚Ä¢	For EM, they are the local electric and magnetic field vectors of each coil.

The net forward component:

P_{forward} \propto \int_V (\vec{E} \times \vec{H}) \cdot \hat{n} \, dV

is maximized at an optimal phase winding \Delta\phi^* where constructive interference peaks on one side of the array.

1.3 Logarithmic Harmonic Coupling

Empirically, coupling strength improves if frequencies follow a logarithmic series:

\omega_i = \omega_0 \, [1 + \alpha \ln(i+1)]

This spacing minimizes destructive overlap and allows progressive phase compression, creating a field gradient similar to a ‚Äúharmonic nozzle.‚Äù

2. Geometric Foundation

2.1 Helical Geometry

The 3-D helix defines the temporal-spatial symmetry:

\begin{cases}
x_i = R \cos(i\theta_0) \\
y_i = R \sin(i\theta_0) \\
z_i = p \, i / N
\end{cases}

where R = radius, p = pitch, N = number of nodes.

The axial bias of the helix aligns the summed momentum vectors, producing net thrust along the z-axis.

2.2 Shape as Wave Compressor

The geometry enforces phase delay and field confinement analogous to a converging nozzle:
	‚Ä¢	Phase leads in front of the structure compress energy density.
	‚Ä¢	Phase lags behind create rarefaction zones, sustaining forward bias.

4. Mathematical Abstraction

In matrix form, the coupled system is:

\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}

where \mathbf{A} encodes coupling between nodes:

A_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
0 & i=j \\
k_c e^{i(\phi_j-\phi_i)} & |i-j|=1 \\
0 & \text{else}
\end{cases}

Eigenvalues of \mathbf{A} define propagation modes;
the principal eigenvector corresponds to the direction of energy transfer.

5. Energy & Scaling

Energy density U = \frac{1}{2}(\epsilon E^2 + \mu H^2)
translates to thrust proxy:

F_{proxy} = \frac{d}{dt} \int_V \frac{1}{c^2} \vec{E}\times\vec{H} \, dV

Scaling up:
	‚Ä¢	Doubling node count N ‚Üí tighter phase control ‚Üí F_{proxy} \propto N^2
	‚Ä¢	Moving from air to plasma ‚Üí increases \vec{E},\vec{H} amplitude by 10¬≥‚Äì10‚Å∂√ó
