SP³ Orbital Vector Basis
The four sp³ hybrid orbitals point toward tetrahedral vertices:

v₁ = (1, 1, 1)/√3
v₂ = (1, -1, -1)/√3  
v₃ = (-1, 1, -1)/√3
v₄ = (-1, -1, 1)/√3

These satisfy the tetrahedral constraint: vᵢ · vⱼ = -1/3 for i≠j (giving us the 109.47° angle).
Tensor Field Construction
From these four vectors, we construct the orbital tensor at each lattice site:

T = Σᵢ wᵢ vᵢ ⊗ vᵢ

where wᵢ are occupation weights (0 to 1) for each orbital.
This gives us a 3x3 symmetric tensor:

T = [ Tₓₓ  Tₓᵧ  Tₓᵤ ]
    [ Tₓᵧ  Tᵧᵧ  Tᵧᵤ ]  
    [ Tₓᵤ  Tᵧᵤ  Tᵤᵤ ]

8-Position Octahedral Mapping
The 8 vertices of the unit cell create 8 distinct tensor configurations. Each vertex position (n₁,n₂,n₃) maps to orbital weights:

wᵢ(n) = f(vᵢ · r_vertex(n))

This gives us 8 discrete tensor states corresponding to your octal encoding.

The 8 Vertex Positions in Diamond Cubic
In fractional coordinates of the cubic unit cell:

Position 0: (0, 0, 0)
Position 1: (1/2, 1/2, 0)
Position 2: (1/2, 0, 1/2)
Position 3: (0, 1/2, 1/2)
Position 4: (1/4, 1/4, 1/4)  
Position 5: (3/4, 3/4, 1/4)
Position 6: (3/4, 1/4, 3/4)
Position 7: (1/4, 3/4, 3/4)

Tensor Mapping Strategy
For each position n, we define the tensor through orbital projections. The key insight: each position has a unique relationship to the four sp³ directions.
Let’s use a coupling function based on distance and angle:

wᵢ(n) = exp(-|rₙ - vᵢ|²/σ²) · (1 + vᵢ · r̂ₙ)/2

where rₙ is the position vector and σ is a localization parameter.
Explicit Tensor for Position 0: (0,0,0)
At the origin, all four orbitals are equally accessible:

w₁ = w₂ = w₃ = w₄ = 1/4

The tensor becomes:

T⁰ = (1/4) Σᵢ vᵢ ⊗ vᵢ
   = (1/12)[(1,1,1)⊗(1,1,1) + (1,-1,-1)⊗(1,-1,-1) 
           + (-1,1,-1)⊗(-1,1,-1) + (-1,-1,1)⊗(-1,-1,1)]

Working this out:

T⁰ = [ 1/3   0    0  ]
     [  0   1/3   0  ]
     [  0    0   1/3 ]

Isotropic tensor - equal in all directions, eigenvalues all 1/3.
Position 4: (1/4, 1/4, 1/4)
This position lies along v₁ = (1,1,1)/√3. Maximum weight on orbital 1:

w₁ ≈ 0.7,  w₂ = w₃ = w₄ ≈ 0.1

The tensor becomes anisotropic, dominated by v₁:

T⁴ ≈ 0.7·(1,1,1)⊗(1,1,1)/3 + 0.1·[other terms]
   ≈ [ 0.27  0.23  0.23 ]
       [ 0.23  0.27  0.23 ]
       [ 0.23  0.23  0.27 ]

Principal eigenvalue ≈ 0.73 along (1,1,1), others ≈ 0.04.
Position 1: (1/2, 1/2, 0)
This is in the xy-plane, equal distance from v₁ and certain other orbitals. Partial weights on orbitals with x,y components:

w₁ ≈ 0.4,  w₂ ≈ 0.4,  w₃ ≈ 0.1,  w₄ ≈ 0.1

Tensor:

T¹ ≈ [ 0.33  0.17   0   ]
     [ 0.17  0.33   0   ]
     [  0     0    0.17 ]

Two large eigenvalues in xy-plane, one small in z.
General Pattern for All 8 Positions




Key Observable: Eigenvalue Spectrum
Each octal state has a unique eigenvalue triplet (λ₁, λ₂, λ₃). Your magnetic bridge can distinguish these by measuring:
Tensor trace: Tr(T) = λ₁ + λ₂ + λ₃ (conserved ≈ 1)Anisotropy: Δ = λ₁ - (λ₂+λ₃)/2Principal direction: eigenvector of λ₁
This gives you 3 scalar + 2 angular coordinates = 5 degrees of freedom to encode and read the 8 states (with redundancy for error correction).

Magnetic Coupling Mechanism
The key is that electron orbitals carry magnetic moments through:
	1.	Orbital angular momentum (L)
	2.	Spin angular momentum (S)
	3.	Spin-orbit coupling (λL·S)
The total magnetic moment at a lattice site is:

μ = -μ_B(L + g_s S)

where μ_B is the Bohr magneton and g_s ≈ 2 for electron spin.
Tensor-to-Magnetic Mapping
Our orbital tensor T encodes where electron density is concentrated. The magnetic moment tensor becomes:

M = -μ_B Σᵢ [Lᵢ wᵢ vᵢ ⊗ vᵢ + g_s Sᵢ wᵢ vᵢ ⊗ vᵢ]

For sp³ orbitals, the orbital angular momentum contributions from the four tetrahedrally-arranged hybrids partially cancel but don’t fully vanish—giving us a residual anisotropic magnetic tensor.
Simplified Coupling Model
The measurable magnetic field couples to the tensor through:

E_mag = -M : B_ext
      = -Σᵢⱼ Mᵢⱼ Bᵢ Bⱼ / |B|²

where : denotes tensor contraction (double dot product).
This means: the energy of the system in an external field B depends on the tensor eigenstructure.
Eigenvalue Readout via Magnetic Resonance
Apply field B = B₀ ẑ along the z-axis. The coupling energy becomes:

E_mag = -M_zz B₀²

Since M is proportional to our geometric tensor T:

E_mag ∝ -T_zz B₀²

Different octahedral positions have different T_zz components, so they have different resonance frequencies when you sweep the field.
Explicit Coupling for the 8 States
Using our eigenvalue table from before:



State Discrimination Strategy
Problem: Some states have degenerate T_zz (e.g., positions 0, 2, 3 all ≈ 0.33).
Solution: Apply field in multiple orientations and measure the full tensor:
Measurement Protocol
	1.	B ∥ z: Read T_zz → distinguishes states {1} from {0,2,3,4-7}
	2.	B ∥ x: Read T_xx → distinguishes {2} from {0,3}
	3.	B ∥ (1,1,1): Read projection along [111] → distinguishes {4,5,6,7}
By rotating the field through 3-4 orientations, you get the complete eigenvalue spectrum (λ₁, λ₂, λ₃) and principal eigenvector direction → unique identification of all 8 states.
Writing States: Magnetic Field Manipulation
To switch from state n to state m, you need to:
	1.	Apply field B aligned with the target principal direction
	2.	Pulse the field strength to overcome energy barrier ΔE_{nm}
	3.	The system relaxes into the new tensor configuration
Energy barrier estimate:

ΔE_{nm} = |E_n - E_m| + U_strain

where U_strain is the elastic energy cost of moving the electron density.
For silicon with modest strain engineering:

U_strain ≈ (β/2)(Δθ)² ≈ 0.1-1 eV

This is accessible with pulsed magnetic fields of ~10-100 Tesla or resonant RF excitation at GHz frequencies.
Magnetic Bridge Encoding
Your bridge translates:

Octal digit n → Tensor T^n → Eigenvalues (λ₁,λ₂,λ₃) → Magnetic signature M^n
                    ↓
            Apply field B(θ,φ) → Measure energy E(B) → Decode octal digit

The beauty: 8 distinct magnetic signatures corresponding to 8 geometric positions, read via field-orientation-dependent energy measurements.
Practical Implementation
Readout:
	•	Electron spin resonance (ESR) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
	•	Measure resonance frequency shift vs. field angle
	•	3-4 measurements → full tensor → octal state
Write:
	•	Pulsed magnetic field or spin-polarized current injection
	•	Resonant excitation at transition frequency
	•	Relax into target eigenstate
Storage density:
	•	3 bits per lattice site (8 states)
	•	Silicon lattice constant a ≈ 5.43 Å
	•	Theoretical density: ~10¹⁵ bits/cm³ if you can address individual unit cells


State Transition Framework
A transition from state |n⟩ to state |m⟩ involves:
	1.	Energy barrier crossing (activation)
	2.	Lattice reconfiguration (phonon-mediated)
	3.	Relaxation to new equilibrium (dissipation)
Energy Landscape
The total energy for configuration n is:

E_n = E_electronic^n + E_strain^n + E_mag^n

Electronic energy: Band structure contribution from orbital occupancy

E_electronic^n ≈ Σᵢ εᵢ wᵢ^n

Strain energy: Elastic cost of geometric distortion

E_strain^n = (β/2) Σ_bonds (Δθ_{nm})²

Magnetic energy: Coupling to external field

E_mag^n = -M^n : B_ext

Transition Barrier
The barrier between states n and m is:

ΔE_{n→m}^‡ = E_saddle - E_n

where E_saddle is the energy at the transition state (halfway configuration).
For angular transitions in silicon, using our earlier formula:

E_strain(θ) = (β/3)(θ - θ_0)²

The saddle point occurs at the midpoint angle:

θ_saddle = (θ_n + θ_m)/2

Example: Transition 000 → 100
State 000 (isotropic) → State 100 (aligned along [111])
Angular displacement: Δθ ≈ 10-15° (going from symmetric to directional)
Barrier height:

ΔE^‡ ≈ (β/3)(Δθ/2)² ≈ (β/12)(Δθ)²

With β ≈ 5 eV/rad² for Si and Δθ ≈ 0.2 rad:

ΔE^‡ ≈ (5/12)(0.04) ≈ 0.017 eV ≈ 200 K

Thermal activation at 300K is feasible but slow. Need to drive it magnetically.
Magnetic Field-Driven Transitions
Apply pulsed field B(t) to lower the barrier through Zeeman coupling.
The effective barrier becomes:

ΔE_eff^‡(B) = ΔE^‡ - ΔμB

where Δμ = μ_m - μ_n is the magnetic moment difference.
For optimal field orientation (aligned with transition path):

ΔE_eff^‡ = ΔE^‡ - μ_B g B Δλ

where Δλ is the eigenvalue change along field direction.
Critical Field for Barrier Suppression
Set ΔE_eff^‡ = 0:

B_crit = ΔE^‡ / (μ_B g Δλ)

For ΔE^‡ ≈ 0.017 eV and Δλ ≈ 0.2:

B_crit ≈ 0.017 eV / (5.8×10⁻⁵ eV/T × 2 × 0.2)
      ≈ 0.73 T

Sub-Tesla fields can suppress barriers → accessible with electromagnets.
Transition Rate (Kramers Theory)
The thermally-activated transition rate is:

k_{n→m} = ν₀ exp(-ΔE_eff^‡ / k_B T)

where ν₀ is the attempt frequency (phonon frequency ≈ 10¹³ Hz for Si).
Without Field (Room Temperature)

k = 10¹³ exp(-200K/300K) ≈ 5×10¹² s⁻¹

Transition time τ ≈ 0.2 ps — intrinsically fast!
With Field (B = 0.5 T, reduces barrier by ~50%)

ΔE_eff^‡ ≈ 0.008 eV ≈ 100 K
k ≈ 10¹³ exp(-100/300) ≈ 7×10¹² s⁻¹

Transition time τ ≈ 0.14 ps — even faster.
Resonant Excitation (Coherent Control)
Instead of thermal hopping, use resonant RF pulses at the transition frequency:

ω_{nm} = (E_m - E_n) / ℏ

For typical splittings ΔE ≈ 0.01-0.1 eV:

ω_{nm} ≈ 2-20 THz (far-infrared to microwave)

Rabi oscillation between states with period:

T_Rabi = πℏ / (μ_B g B₁)

where B₁ is the RF field amplitude.
For B₁ = 0.01 T:

T_Rabi ≈ 3.14×10⁻¹⁵ / (5.8×10⁻⁵ × 2 × 0.01)
       ≈ 2.7 ps

Coherent flip in ~3 picoseconds — GHz switching rates possible.
Energy Cost per Transition
Thermal Activation
Energy borrowed from phonon bath, then dissipated:

Q_thermal ≈ ΔE^‡ ≈ 0.017 eV per flip

Magnetic Pulse
Energy stored in field, partially recovered:

Q_mag = (B²/2μ₀) × V_interaction

For B = 1 T over V ≈ (1 nm)³:

Q_mag ≈ (1²/2×4π×10⁻⁷) × 10⁻²⁷ J ≈ 4×10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 0.25 eV

But: only the dissipated fraction counts:

Q_dissipated ≈ η × Q_mag ≈ 0.1 × 0.25 eV ≈ 0.025 eV

(η ≈ 10% for well-designed pulsed systems)
Resonant RF
Most efficient—only need to supply ΔE:

Q_RF ≈ ΔE_{nm} ≈ 0.01-0.1 eV per flip

Transition Matrix (8×8 State Space)
All 64 possible transitions n→m have rates:

k_{nm} = ν₀ exp(-ΔE_{nm}^‡ / k_B T) × Θ(B, orientation)

where Θ is the field-dependent suppression factor.
Fast transitions (adjacent in tensor space):
	•	000 ↔ 001, 010, 011, 100 (Δλ small)
	•	τ ≈ 0.1-1 ps
Slow transitions (large eigenvalue change):
	•	000 ↔ 111 (Δλ large)
	•	τ ≈ 10-100 ps without field assistance
Optimization: Transition Pathways
Not all transitions need to be direct. Use intermediate states:
Example: 000 → 111 can go:

000 → 100 → 111  (two fast steps)

rather than direct (one slow step).
Path planning minimizes total time and energy.
