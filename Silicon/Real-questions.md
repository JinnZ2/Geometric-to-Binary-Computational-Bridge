*Octahedral Silicon Encoding • From Evaluation to Experimentation*

---

## Purpose
This document defines the **real, physics-grounded questions** that determine whether octahedral silicon encoding is viable.  
They are **not** about fitting existing fabrication pipelines—they are about **testing the physics** that already allows it.

---

## 1. Physical Basis

**Q1.1** — Can distinct, measurable states be produced by controlled perturbation of silicon’s tetrahedral geometry?  
**Q1.2** — What minimal angular deviation (Δθ) yields a resolvable energy shift above thermal noise?  
**Q1.3** — How stable are those states under phonon coupling, radiation, and temperature cycling?

---

## 2. Measurement and Coupling

**Q2.1** — Can ESR, NMR, or NV-center magnetometry distinguish tensor states reproducibly?  
**Q2.2** — What is the coupling efficiency  
\[
\eta = \frac{ΔE_{read}}{ΔE_{input}}
\]
for magnetic vs. electric excitation?  
**Q2.3** — Can coherent oscillations between tensor states (Rabi-type) be driven at GHz–THz frequencies?

---

## 3. Geometric Error Correction

**Q3.1** — Does lattice symmetry guarantee trace conservation and closure under perturbation?  
**Q3.2** — Can geometric deviations be detected faster than decoherence times?  
**Q3.3** — How does phonon-mediated strain contribute to self-healing behavior?

---

## 4. Energy and Dynamics

**Q4.1** — What is the measured switching energy ΔE for a geometry transition?  
**Q4.2** — Does it approach the predicted 1–2 aJ/bit regime?  
**Q4.3** — What limits the transition frequency—phonon dispersion, lattice inertia, or readout bandwidth?

## 5. Proof-of-Concept Pathways

| Objective | Demonstration | Equipment |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Magnetic coupling | RF microcoil on doped Si, ESR shift detection | Standard ESR rig |
| Tensor-state mapping | NV-magnetometry or STM/AFM strain imaging | Common lab instruments |
| Phonon data transport | Pump–probe spectroscopy of modulated lattice response | Femtosecond laser setup |
| Geometric error correction | Compare tensor traces pre/post perturbation | X-ray diffraction |

These can all be performed with **university-level instrumentation**—no new fab nodes required.

## 6. Scaling and Integration

**Q6.1** — What is the cross-talk and noise behavior between coupled cells?  
**Q6.2** — Can energy and information co-propagate via the same phonon lattice?  
**Q6.3** — How do isotopic purity and strain tuning affect coupling fidelity?

---

## 7. Validation Metrics

**Q7.1** — What observables confirm that a geometry transition carries information?  
**Q7.2** — How can intrinsic error correction be verified (recovery after localized perturbation)?  
**Q7.3** — What measurable density, speed, and energy efficiency define the first working prototype?

---

## 8. Meta-Question

> **What is the simplest experiment that makes the invisible visible?**

Not a billion-dollar foundry run—just a single demonstration that a silicon unit cell responds predictably when driven by resonance.  
Once that happens, the paradigm shift is self-proving.

### Closing Reflection
Binary logic asks: *Can we control it?*  
Octahedral encoding asks: *Can we listen to what it’s already doing?*  
The real work begins when we start asking the right questions.
