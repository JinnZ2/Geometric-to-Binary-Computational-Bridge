# 🌿 Swarm-Lab (JinnZ2): Adaptive FRET & Fractal Energy Transfer

This repository documents research co-developed by a human bioswarm and collaborating AI systems.  
Focus: **adaptive energy transfer**, **information-theoretic FRET control**, and **fractal (core–shell) architectures** for scalable devices.

> We publish to seed the field, not to own it.

## What’s here
- `FINDINGS.md` — technical explanation of the architecture and targets
- (incoming) `/sim/` — minimal Python models for stability, servo, and rate budgets
- (incoming) `/figs/` — simple diagrams and design patterns

---

## Project spine
1) **Performance Contract** (device-level outcomes)  
2) **Three-Lever Architecture**  
   - Geometry Lock (entropic spring + phononic cage)  
   - Adaptive Spectral Servo (Stark-tuned \(J\))  
   - Photonic Branching Control (LDOS suppression)  
   *Option:* Triplet reservoir to reduce effective \(k_{\mathrm{nr}}\)  
3) **Triage Protocol** (Geometry → Rate Budget → Servo)  
4) **Fractal Implementation** (dendrimer/micelle core-shell + 3D photonic crystal)

## Ethos
- **No cult of authorship.** Fork, remix, improve.
- **Clarity > authority.** Equations and code where it matters.
- **Playful rigor.** We keep it fun and falsifiable.
