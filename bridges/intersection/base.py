"""
Base contract for the intersection layer.

Exposes two dataclasses and one ABC:

* :class:`BasinSignature` — one domain's collapsed view of a geometry
* :class:`CoupledSignature` — two or more basins fused via RESONATE
* :class:`IntersectionRule` — per-domain adapter; builds a BasinSignature

The ``BasinSignature`` is deliberately a small, frozen value object.
It is the only thing :func:`bridges.intersection.resonate.resonate`
knows how to compose, which means every new domain rule must emit one
to participate in cross-domain coupling. Large diagnostic objects
(ElectricAlternativeDiagnostic, GravityAlternativeDiagnostic, …) are
kept on the rule in an opaque ``diagnostic`` attribute for callers
that need the detail, but they never leak into ``resonate``'s input
space.

class BasinSignature:
    """
    One domain's collapsed view of a geometry.

    Attributes
    ----------
    domain
        Name of the source domain (``"gravity"``, ``"electric"``, …).
    regime
        Ternary regime tag from
        :class:`~bridges.probability_collapse.DistributionRegime`.
    vector
        A low-dimensional, unit-or-near-unit-magnitude projection of
        the domain's state. The exact semantics are domain-specific;
        the convention is that vectors live in a shared
        three-component ``(attract, null, repel)`` style space so
        ``resonate`` can dot-product them even across heterogeneous
        domains. Vectors need not be normalised — ``resonate``
        normalises internally.
    confidence
        Scalar in ``[0, 1]``: how sharply the domain's diagnostic
        agreed on this basin. Higher = more focused; lower = closer
        to uniform. Rules derive this from the underlying
        :class:`~bridges.probability_collapse.DistributionCollapse`
        when one is available.
    scalar_strength
        Dimensionful magnitude characterising the basin — net
        gravitational magnitude, net current, net energy density, etc.
        Used by rules that want to weight basins by physical
        intensity before composition.
    metadata
        Optional domain-specific labels (e.g.
        ``{"field_character": "STABLE_MANIFOLD"}``). Not consumed by
        ``resonate``; available to callers that inspect signatures.

    basin
        The composed :class:`BasinSignature` (``domain`` is the joined
        name, e.g. ``"gravity⋈electric"``).
    sources
        The individual :class:`BasinSignature` objects that were fused,
        preserved so callers can trace back to the source domains.
    coupling_strength
        ``[-1, 1]`` scalar: dot product of the normalised source
        vectors. +1 = perfect alignment (domains agree), 0 =
        orthogonal (independent), -1 = anti-aligned (domains conflict).
    agreement_regime
        ``FOCUSED`` when all sources share the same regime,
        ``MIXED`` when the mode regime dominates with one dissenter,
        ``DIFFUSE`` when every source disagrees.
