# Translation Guide — Geometric-to-Binary Computational Bridge

## Purpose
Create a clear workflow that converts **visual / spatial cognition** into **binary computational structure** with minimal translation loss.

## 1. Core Idea Flow
| Stage | Description | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Symbolic** | Intuitive or geometric perception (what is “seen”) | Nested φ-shells, spiral growth, convergence field |
| **Geometric** | Express as measurable geometry (.gshape schema) | Coordinates, angles, ratios, symmetry rules |
| **Mathematical** | Derive algebraic or tensor form | Differential form, φ-ratio matrices, curvature tensors |
| **Binary** | Encode into machine-readable structures | JSON, bitfields, arrays, code |
| **Hardware / Visualization** | Execute and observe results | Simulation, 3-D plot, sensor output |

## 2. Workflow Example — *φ-Shell Convergence*

1. Visualize nested φ-scaled shells (E = φⁿ mc² analogy).  
2. Express as geometric coordinates in `.gshape`:

3. shell {
base_radius = 1.0
scale = phi
layers = 5
}



3. Bridge converts to binary arrays:

   [1.000, 1.618, 2.618, 4.236, 6.854]


   4. Visualizer renders hyperbolic surface and φ-rings.  
5. Measure translation loss → compare radii to theoretical φⁿ.

## 3. Translation-Loss Metric
Define a relative error measure:
\[
L = \frac{|G_{out} - G_{in}|}{|G_{in}|}
\]
where \(G_{in}\) is the intended geometry and \(G_{out}\) is the decoded output.

Target: **L < 0.02** (less than 2 % geometric distortion).

---

## 4. Next Steps
- Automate `.gshape → .bin → .viz` pipeline.
- Add command-line helper script `bridge_convert.py`.
- Document additional symbolic mappings: spiral, braid, resonance net.
