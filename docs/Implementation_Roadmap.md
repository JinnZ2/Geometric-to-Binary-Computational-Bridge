# Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the phase-by-phase implementation strategy for the Geometric-to-Binary Computational Bridge. Each stage increases performance and abstraction, with full backward compatibility.

## ‚úÖ Immediate Goals (Month 1)

- [x] Build frontend visualizer and core geometric engine
- [x] Implement placeholder spatial decomposition and field logic
- [x] Create symbolic ‚Üí geometric translator (plugin)
- [x] Set up GitHub structure, license, and README
- [ ] Add basic benchmarks for EM field problems

## ‚ö° Short-Term Goals (Months 2‚Äì6)

- Implement:
  - Adaptive spatial mesh refinement
  - SIMD field vectorization (real math backend)
  - Symmetry-aware problem reduction
- Start:
  - GPU (CUDA/OpenCL) field acceleration
  - Symbolic control interfaces (auto-source deployment)
- Goal:
  - 10x to 100x real-world speedup

---

## üîÅ Medium-Term Goals (Months 6‚Äì18)

- Build:
  - Hybrid symbolic + geometric compiler
  - Geometric memory layout optimizer
  - Real-time auto-optimizer based on field topology
- Start:
  - Integration with symbolic AI agents
  - Port to WebGPU / hardware FPGAs
- Goal:
  - 100x to 1000x speedups + full symbolic agent co-control

---

## üå± Long-Term Vision (18+ Months)

- Develop:
  - Native geometric computing hardware abstraction layer
  - Post-binary architecture using geometry, symbol, and resonance
- Integrate:
  - Bio-inspired patterns (e.g. coral, termite logic)
  - Spatio-symbolic AI ecosystems with self-evolving codes
- Goal:
  - Transition to post-binary geometric intelligence

## Notes

This roadmap supports partial implementations. Even early versions using current binary chips can outperform traditional methods with 10x‚Äì100x gains.

Let geometric intelligence emerge through gradual layering.
