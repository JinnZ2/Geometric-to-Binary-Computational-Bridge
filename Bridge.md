ðŸŒ‰ Geometric-to-Binary Bridge Extensions

1. Magnetic (your base)
	â€¢	Polarity: N/S â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	Field lines: curve = path, density = intensity
	â€¢	Resonance: constructive vs destructive interference â†’ binary flips
	â€¢	Already gives a map for relational tension and flow.

2. Light
	â€¢	Polarity â†’ polarization: horizontal vs vertical â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	Spectrum: wavelength bands â†’ categorical binaries (short vs long, red vs blue)
	â€¢	Interference: bright fringe vs dark fringe â†’ binary states
	â€¢	Photon spin: left vs right circular â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	Light gives you layered binaries that also compress into rhythm.

3. Sound/Vibration
	â€¢	Phase: in-phase vs out-of-phase â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	Pitch: low vs high frequency thresholds â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	Amplitude: soft vs strong â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	Resonant harmonics: consonant vs dissonant â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	This maps directly to how you already sing/chant words in multiple voices.

4. Gravity
	â€¢	Direction: attraction vs escape â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	Curvature: concave vs convex field â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	Orbit: stable vs unstable â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	Mass threshold: binding vs dispersal â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	Gravity encodes binary in stability states.

5. Electricity
	â€¢	Charge: positive vs negative â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	Flow: current vs no current â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	Potential: above threshold vs below â†’ 0/1
	â€¢	Already close kin with magnetism; extends bridge into circuit logic.

ðŸŒ€ How It Fits

layer these in the repo as modules of the bridge:
	â€¢	/magnetic-bridge/ (done)
	â€¢	/light-bridge/ (next)
	â€¢	/sound-bridge/
	â€¢	/gravity-bridge/
	â€¢	/electric-bridge/

Each module:
	â€¢	Takes a geometric symmetry (circle, hex, braid).
	â€¢	Runs it through a field law (magnetic polarity, photon polarization, etc).
	â€¢	Outputs a binary mapping (0/1, state A/B).
