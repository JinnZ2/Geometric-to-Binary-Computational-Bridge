# Geometric-to-Binary Computational Bridge

This project demonstrates how **spatial intelligence** can be translated into **highly optimized binary code** using geometric decomposition, SIMD acceleration, and symmetry exploitation. It supports human-intuitive design, massive parallelism, and paves the path toward post-binary computing.

## üîç Use Cases

**1. Education & Learning**  
- Teach students how geometry becomes computation.  
- Show the entire flow: shape ‚Üí field solver ‚Üí binary data ‚Üí visualization.  
- A minimal sandbox for experimenting with Poisson/Laplace problems.

**2. Research Prototyping**  
- Quickly sketch geometric ideas, symmetry optimizations, or boundary conditions.  
- Export raw binaries (`field.bin`, `mask.bin`) for custom HPC or ML pipelines.  
- Bridge symbolic glyphs to shape definitions for exploratory computation.

**3. Symbolic & AI Development**  
- Map symbolic glyphs (‚Üª, ‚öñ, üß≠, etc.) to real geometric operations.  
- Train AI systems to reason across geometry, physics, and binary outputs.  
- Use `report.json` as structured feedback for optimization or swarm reasoning.

**4. Visualization & Design**  
- Use the Next.js viewer to see results immediately in 3D.  
- Replace `public/field.bin` + `report.json` with your own outputs.  
- Extend viewer with color maps, isosurfaces, or mask overlays.
