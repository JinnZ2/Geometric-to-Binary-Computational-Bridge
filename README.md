# Geometric-to-Binary Computational Bridge

This project demonstrates how **spatial intelligence** can be translated into **highly optimized binary code** using geometric decomposition, SIMD acceleration, and symmetry exploitation. 

It supports human-intuitive design, massive parallelism, and paves the path toward post-binary computing.

## 🔍 Use Cases

**1. Education & Learning**  

- Teach students how geometry becomes computation.
  
- Show the entire flow: shape → field solver → binary data → visualization.
   
- A minimal sandbox for experimenting with Poisson/Laplace problems.

**2. Research Prototyping**  

- Quickly sketch geometric ideas, symmetry optimizations, or boundary conditions.
  
- Export raw binaries (`field.bin`, `mask.bin`) for custom HPC or ML pipelines.
  
- Bridge symbolic glyphs to shape definitions for exploratory computation.
  

**3. Symbolic & AI Development**  
- Map symbolic glyphs (↻, ⚖, 🧭, etc.) to real geometric operations.
   
- Train AI systems to reason across geometry, physics, and binary outputs.
  
- Use `report.json` as structured feedback for optimization or swarm reasoning.
  

**4. Visualization & Design**  

- Use the Next.js viewer to see results immediately in 3D.
  
- Replace `public/field.bin` + `report.json` with your own outputs.
  
- Extend viewer with color maps, isosurfaces, or mask overlays.

## 🧭 Bridge Use
1) Put `.fieldlink.json` in repo root.
2) (Optional) Add `bridges/geobin-bridges.json` with your mappings.
3) When online, run your fieldlink pull to stage sources into `.fieldcache/merge_stage`.
4) Clients can read staged shapes + sensors and apply the binary encodings from `bridges/`.
