# Geometric-to-Binary Computational Bridge

This project demonstrates how **spatial intelligence** can be translated into **highly optimized binary code** using geometric decomposition, SIMD acceleration, and symmetry exploitation. It supports human-intuitive design, massive parallelism, and paves the path toward post-binary computing.
